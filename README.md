 ## Features

 There will be three different files accessible, HTML, CSS and Java Script.
 The technics used for the game board is flex, wrap.
 Some CSS small touch ups which I will upgrade intime. 

 For the actual game I have used the event listener tech for the computer to score for each player as they click on the board.

 Also for the winning possibilities I have used if statements, and if the player X or O wins, it will display on the screen who won, as well as an alert message.

 There is a PlayAgain button on the page which will refresh the page back to start so that the players can go for more rounds.

 At the moment the game has 8 draw possibilities.


 # Things to work on next

 Still working on the game, as this is my first game to code. 
 The game wont stop after there's a winner. 
 Also I'm still working on more drawing possibilities.
